In this project, I developed an Address Lookup application using Angular for the front-end and Java Spring Boot for the back-end. The application allows users to input an address and retrieve detailed location information, including latitude, longitude, and other geographic data. The front-end, built with Angular, provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for entering addresses and displaying results. The back-end, implemented with Java Spring Boot, handles address processing and communicates with external geocoding APIs to fetch the required location details. This project demonstrates effective integration between a modern front-end framework and a robust back-end service, showcasing skills in full-stack development, API integration, and responsive design. The repository includes comprehensive documentation and deployment instructions.
